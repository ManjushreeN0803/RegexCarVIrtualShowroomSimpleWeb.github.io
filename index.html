                <h2>:> De Tomaso P72 <:</h2>
                <img src="images/1.webp" alt="Car 1">
                <h3>Price: $1.3 Million</h3>
                <p> The De Tomaso P72 is basically the definition of beautiful. The shapely supercar debuted at the 2019 Goodwood Festival Of Speed with a supercharged Ford V8 boasting 700 horsepower. The P72 marked the return of the DeTomaso brand after nearly 30 years on hiatus, and if you want one, it will cost you at least $1.3 million.</p>

                <h2>:> Czinger 21C <:</h2>
                <img src="images/2.webp" alt="Car 2">
                <h3>Price: $1.7 Million</h3>
                <p>You might not know the name Czinger yet, but this California-based boutique automaker is responsible for the $1.7 million 21C supercar. With 1,250 horsepower on tap thanks to a 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8, the 21C can rocket to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds and a top speed of around 281 miles per hour.</p>

                <h2>:> Bentley Bacalar <:</h2>
                <img src="images/3.webp" alt="Car 2">
                <h3>Price: $1.9 Million</h3>
                <p> With just 12 total units produced, the Bentley Bacalar makes some of the "limited" cars on this list look plentiful by comparison. Although the car’s opulent design may be the first thing to grab your attention, the Bacalar is no slouch in terms of performance either. With Bentley’s signature turbocharged 6.0-liter W12 turbocharged engine, this car delivers 650 horsepower and 664 pound-feet. If you have a spare $1.9 million lying around and are considering buying one, you’re already too late – Bentley says that every example is now in customer hands.</p>

            <h2>:> BMW iX <:</h2>
            <img src="images/4.webp" alt="Car 2">
            <h3>Price: $87,100</h3>
            <p>BMW will do battery versions of all its mainstream models – as it already has with the Mini Electric and iX3 – but it also wanted to build this all-in electric car as a showcase for its best work on materials, aerodynamics and driver assist. The iX is a big comfy home-on-wheels, and a vast amount of technology has been poured into making sure the driver is soothed while the passengers kick back.

        <h2>:> Kia Sportage Hybrid <:</h2>
        <img src="images/5.jpg" alt="Car 2">
        <h3>Price: $28,545</h3>
        <p>The Kia Sportage was completely redesigned for the 2023 model year, and for the first time, there's an available hybrid model. It's the brand's third hybrid SUV, positioned above the smaller hybrid Niro and below the larger Sorento Hybrid. Looking at it, most won't think it's a Sportage because it looks nothing like the previous model and its interior is a vast improvement over the last one. The compact SUV is larger, offering more passenger and cargo room. In fact, its cargo now offers more space than the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid and Honda CR-V Hybrid.</p>
